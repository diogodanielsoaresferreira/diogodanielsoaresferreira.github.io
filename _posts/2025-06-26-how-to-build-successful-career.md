Hi there! I have been working in Software Engineering for a few years now, and along the way, I've discovered some lessons I wish I knew earlier.
These aren't technical skills or silver bullets, but they've helped me shape a long-term approach to my career.
I'm writing this as a reminder to my future self, but I hope they can be useful to you too.

## Have a clear long-term goal.

Over the course of your career, it's important to know where do you want to go, instead of drifting without direction.
Where do you want to be in 10 years?

Do you want to work in a big tech company? Start your own business? Work abroad? Retire early?
Do you want to switch roles or industries? Be a manager, or to work in a specific technology?

Knowing the answer to this question is essential to know what you should do today to achieve it.
Be as specific as you want. The more specific it is, the easier to visualize it and stay motivated along the way.

If you know where you want to go, you can also better manage the risk - “Should I take this risky opportunity if I’m already close to my goal?” It’s also wise to have a plan B in case things don’t go as expected.

## Most returns are compound. Play the long-term game.
Careers can be very long. Decades long. Yet, most of us think of careers in a short time-frame: the next promotion, the next opportunity. However, as with most things in life, returns are compound. Not just in wealth, but in skills, experience and relationships.

Sometimes it's better to sacrifice short-term gain for a long-term advantage - “Should I switch companies now for a higher salary, or stay to deepen my skills and grow into a better professional?”.
If you already have a long-term goal in mind, the answer becomes clearer.

## Surrond yourself with people smarter than you.
Your most valuable asset in your career is your knowledge. Keep learning consistently, and over time you’ll surpass those with more years of experience who stopped learning along the way.
One of the best ways to learn is by work with people who are better than you.

> “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” - Jim Rohn

We naturally absorb the behavior, work ethic, and mindset of those around us. That’s why your colleagues are one of the biggest influences on your career. Work with people you admire and respect. It should be a major factor in your decision to join (or leave) a company.

## Learn from your failures.
Let's face it: everyone faces failure. Some of these failures are small, and others can undo years of effort. But failuer doesn't define a career, it shapes it.

Each failure is an opportunity to learn something valuable. As painful as it may be, it contributes to your growth, if you’re willing to reflect and adapt.

Recognize your failures, fail fast and learn from them.

## Balance is key.
Your career is not a sprint, it's a marathon. Life has many facets: career, health, relationships, finances, mental well-being. You're only as strong as our weakest area.
If you focus too much on your career and neglect the rest, you risk burnout and dissatisfaction.

Have an holistic approach. A sustainable, fulfilling career is built on consistency, not constant overwork.

## Enjoy the ride!
What you’ll truly remember years from now aren’t the titles you held or the size of your paycheck, but the good moments with your teammates. The late-night product launches, the mentors who believed in you, the times you struggled and grew, the laughs during coffe breaks.

We often get so focused on getting ahead that we forget to look around. Celebrate the small wins. Reflect on how far you’ve come. Be present in your day-to-day. Make time to connect with others. These moments are what truly give meaning to your career.


I hope you can take these tips and use them to improve your career!

Thanks for reading!
