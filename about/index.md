Hi! I'm Diogo Ferreira and I love to use and learn about machine learning techniques, mainly Deep Learning. Currently, I work at Talkdesk Innovation Lab (TDX) in Aveiro, where I am Data Scientist and Backend Engineer of NLP-related projects. I have finished my Masters in Computer and Telematics Engineering, with a thesis about forecasting techniques in 5G networks and its implementation to improve the network behavior (with a 20/20 grade).

I love doing online courses to learn more about machine learning, such as the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng in Coursera, the Deep Learning Specialization by Deep Learning.ai, or CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning by Stanford University.

Beyond the digital world, I am also passionate about music, having attended several music summer festivals in the past years. I also enjoy sports, having played football for 12 years.

Finally, I am also a member of the Portuguese Scouts (CNE), being a candidate to scout leader.
