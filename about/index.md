Hi! I'm Diogo Ferreira and I have 4 years of experience, mainly in event-driven architectures, working with technologies such as Java, Kotlin, Scala, Kafka, Relational (PostgreSQL) and Non-relational Databases (Elasticsearch). Currently, I work at Blip, where I am Backend Engineer. I have also been in Talkdesk, where I worked with awesome technologies, such as Quarkus, Apache Camel, and so much more.

I have finished my Masters in Computer and Telematics Engineering, with a thesis about forecasting techniques in 5G networks and its implementation to improve the network behavior (with a 20/20 grade).

I love doing online courses to learn more Computer Science, such as the Akka Essentials with Scala, Akka Streams with Scala, Think Like a Leader, or Deployment of Machine Learning Models.

Beyond the digital world, I am also a member of the Portuguese Scouts (CNE), being a scout leader. I am also passionate about running, having run multiple half marathons in the past years. I also enjoy music, having attended several music summer festivals.
