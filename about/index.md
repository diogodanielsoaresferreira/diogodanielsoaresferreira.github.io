Hi! I'm Diogo Ferreira and I am Software Engineer with +5 years of experience, mainly in event-driven architectures, working with technologies such as Java, Kotlin, Scala, Quarkus, Spring, Kubernetes, Flink, Akka, Kafka, Relational (PostgreSQL) and Non-relational Databases (Elasticsearch).

When I'm not coding, I may be reading (check out my Goodreads <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/142999797?shelf=read">![Timefold_Logo](https://s.gr-assets.com/images/badge/badge1.jpg){: style="display:inline; height:20px"}</a>) or running (check out my Strava <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/67910674">![Timefold_Logo](../assets/img/strava.svg){: style="display:inline; height:20px"}</a>).

I am also a big enthusiast of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement">FIRE</a> movement and of financial literacy.
