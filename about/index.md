Hi! I'm Diogo Ferreira and I have a special interest in cloud and data-driven architectures. Currently, I work at Blip, where I am Backend Engineer. I have also been in Talkdesk, where I worked with awesome technologies, such as Quarkus, Apache Camel, Kafka, Elastic Search, Databricks, and so much more.

I have finished my Masters in Computer and Telematics Engineering, with a thesis about forecasting techniques in 5G networks and its implementation to improve the network behavior (with a 20/20 grade).

I love doing online courses to learn more Computer Science, such as the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng in Coursera, the Deep Learning Specialization by Deep Learning.ai, or CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning by Stanford University.

Beyond the digital world, I am also a member of the Portuguese Scouts (CNE), being a scout leader.

Finally, I am also passionate about music, having attended several music summer festivals in the past years. I also enjoy sports, having played football for 12 years.
